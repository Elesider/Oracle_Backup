1.  [BSIM Group Modeling of MOSFET](http://bsim.berkeley.edu/models/) develops physics-based accurated predictive MOSFET SPICE model.When the physic model becomes too much
    complicated after BSIM 3 Square Law Equation. **It is beyond the human's comprehensive**. New Tools and infrasctures have to be introduced to help to design and validate a
    circuit. The wisdom of a human is much limited to its current form. One can only understand part of the thing through a way one can comprehend such as creating a list of
    beautiful equations. Too much time are spent on discrib, understanding, explain and summarize the measured result. Sometimes, it is even impossible. The more is different such as the VLSI. Nowadays, we need to understand a topic through the tools and infrascture. In the future, we are here to help the tools to understand the world.
